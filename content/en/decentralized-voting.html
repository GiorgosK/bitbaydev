              <p>In the crypto community we are all familiar with the Bitcoin fiasco over blockchain sizing. This issue
                seems so simple to fix, yet the complexity to execute is almost comical. It demonstrates Bitcoin has
                become a truly centralized governance hodgepodge consisting of centralized miners and self-appointed
                developers. This has led to talks of forking Bitcoin into 2 separate entities. BitBay’s Decentralized
                Voting update in Client v1.26 helps to eliminate these issues Bitcoin is facing.</p>

              <p>With BitBay, gridlock will no longer be an issue for future innovations and development. The core build
                developer, David Zimbeck, has integrated a decentralized voting UI built into the Client. This voting
                protocol will serve multiple purposes.</p>

              <p>The main purpose is for it to work alongside the decentralized algorithm to regulate the dynamic peg
                technology (due to be complete by the end of the year). This method will grant miners the ability to
                cast their vote for either increasing or shrinking the current amount of liquid BAY coins available.
                Miners will be given 3 options; to manually vote for increase, manually vote for decrease, or let the
                algorithm decide for them.</p>

              <p>Unlike other coins with decentralized voting features, this UI is extremely user friendly – no coding
                skills are required. Each vote costs almost nothing to cast, at 0.00005554 BAY. Requiring a fee and
                using staking to inject votes on the blockchain helps regulate and protect the vote from spam and
                minimizes short term manipulation. The system will then gradually inject those votes onto the blockchain
                as your wallet remains open and staking (or cold staking). This creates a ‘fair’ playing field for the
                entire community. For example, imagine a vote that has the community split between the majority of the
                small and medium coin holders against a minority of large coin holders. Since the majority acts as one
                voice and has stronger processing powers to stake for each block, they could essentially outweigh the
                minority ‘whales’, and win majority consensus!</p>

              <p>The voting system provides custom capabilities as well. Voting in the Client can be started by anyone
                by entering a 20-character string into the UI, and then specifying how many votes they wish to cast for
                that item. The 20-character string allows for nearly unlimited voting possibilities. The UI even
                provides you with a tool to count the votes through the Client. These votes can be private or as public
                as you wish to broadcast them. The string entered into the UI field simply converts to a blockchain
                address (burned) that anyone can track on the blockchain. This creates the opportunity for anyone to
                track other Client accounts also participating in the vote. This will open up the ability to create
                decentralized prediction markets similar to AUGUR! Imagine in the future where you can ask for proven
                market analysts to vote on your market request! This has the ability to turn into decentralized money
                management without the advisors even holding your investment capital!</p>

              <p>The possibilities with this decentralized voting UI will add yet another amazing milestone for the most
                advanced cryptocurrency wallet on the planet… and this is just the beginning! Adaptability is key to
                remaining ahead of the competition and now that we have a voice to vote for virtually anything, new
                innovations to BitBay will never be stifled and bogged down by gridlock and politics.</p>
