              <p><em>Sometimes you don’t need to reinvent the wheel, you just have to improve it.</em></p>

              <p>With BitBay’s easy Buy/Sell Anything template, you can now create your very own <strong>auctions and
                  reverse auctions</strong>. You can have bidders compete to give you maximum profit for your sale, or
                you can have sellers compete to sell you any item that you are looking for.</p>

              <h3>What is a Reverse Auction?</h3>

              <p>Reverse auctions are exactly what they sound like. In these scenarios, a buyer can list a specific item
                they desire to purchase, and have sellers bid on selling it to them. This creates a natural competition
                for sellers to underbid each other, giving the buyer an option to buy the desired item at a lower price.
              </p>

              <p><strong>Our Auction and Reverse Auctions offer a solution that:</strong></p>

              <ul>
                <li>Doesn’t require a 3rd party or middleman to collect high fees</li>
                <li>Securely and neutrally enforces both parties to honor their transaction</li>
                <li>Doesn’t require user’s to give up their own valuable personal information</li>
                <li>Respects the freedom of people</li>
                <li>Is 100% decentralized</li>
              </ul>

              <p>With BitBay, you will never have to worry about high fees. Using our revolutionary <a
                  href="double-deposit-escrow">double deposit escrow</a>, both buyer and seller simply lock in a deposit
                to enforce transaction completion. This completely eliminates the need for a middleman, who always takes
                their cut. This creates a <strong>neutral, secure, and global</strong> medium for business to be
                conducted…<strong>completely peer-to-peer and without high fees</strong>.</p>
