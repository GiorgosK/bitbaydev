              <p>Looking for an easy way to exchange fiat and BAY directly peer-to-peer, without a middleman?</p>

              <p>With our user-friendly <strong>Cash For Coins</strong> template, this is now possible. Thanks to the
                power of double-deposit escrow, you can now easily set up a contract to <em><strong>purchase
                    BAY</strong></em> with fiat, or <em><strong>sell BAY</strong></em> for fiat within our marketplace.
              </p>

              <p>One of the <strong>largest obstacles</strong> to the adoption of the BitBay platform (and all other
                cryptocurrencies) is a <strong>lack of decentralized fiat-to-crypto gateways</strong>.</p>

              <p>Until now, many people have used centralized cryptocurrency exchanges in order to convert their fiat
                into BAY and back. This unsatisfactory method creates a significant bottleneck for liquidity, and poses
                a massive security threat to individuals’ privacy and funds.</p>

              <p>With auto-calculated exchange rates and custom fee integration, the Cash For Coins template is a great
                solution for everyone around the world to enter BitBay’s ecosystem.</p>

              <p><strong>Don’t have enough BAY to use for a deposit? That’s okay!</strong></p>

              <p>You can always select the guarantor contract option, which lets your fiat payment itself act as
                collateral for the transaction. In these scenarios, the other party will still lock-in a deposit of BAY,
                which forces them to honor the transaction.</p>

              <p>Our goal is to provide an equal opportunity for EVERYONE around the world to utilize our platform. This
                template, in addition to our other templates, brings that goal into reality.</p>
