              <p>The internet is wonderful, but hackers and scammers are an increasing problem – especially where money
                is involved. That is why BitBay is paying particular attention to security. We believe we have managed
                to create the most secure platform for transactions on the internet that the world has ever seen.</p>

              <h3>Unhackable wallet</h3>

              <p>Every account uses two keys! Your account is&nbsp;<strong>virtually&nbsp;</strong>unhackable especially
                if two locations are used (2FA). Sign transactions from two locations at once. All of this is automated
                in the software. Give each key a different password! Security on a whole new level.</p>

              <h3>Steganography</h3>

              <p>Hide your keys inside of images making them impossible to find. The most common way wallets are stolen
                is from a hacker searching for common names like “wallet.dat”. Now you can hide your keys in a photo! A
                hacker would not even know where to start looking as he would have to decode every single picture on
                your computer. As a bonus, you can hide and reveal files inside of images for sending secure information
                to friends.</p>

              <h3>Encrypted communication</h3>

              <p>All communication is encrypted regardless if you use Bitmessage or email. No hacker will be able to
                read your communication, and use that to scam you. Only through the use of your Client's public and
                private keys can you decrypt communication with counterparties.</p>

              <h3>Smart contracts</h3>

              <p>Your trade transactions are protected by smart contracts, making fraud meaningless as it hurts the
                fraudsters just as much as you</p>

              <h3>Decentralized</h3>

              <p>There is no server someone can hack to exploit you.</p>

              <h3>Anonymity</h3>

              <p>You are anonymous, so no one can get your personal information. Send private smart contracts directly
                to your counterparty's bitmessage or email address. Spoofing is no longer possible</p>

              <h3>Anti-Keylogger</h3>

              <p>Our amazing virtual keyboard option allows you to enter your password without clicking or typing. It
                also allows you to click on keys and type at the same time. This is absolutely essential if you are
                storing a lot of funds.&nbsp;<strong>Even mouse loggers will be no match unless every movement is
                  recorded.</strong></p>

              <h3>Cold Staking</h3>

              <p>In order to stake coins users must unlock their wallet. But that creates a risk with the password
                stored in memory especially if they are connected through an API. However using our two step spending,
                users can now stake using two computers. This makes your
                account&nbsp;<strong>virtually&nbsp;</strong>impossible to hack.</p>

              <h3>Bitmessage</h3>

              <p>Thanks to&nbsp;<a href="https://bitmessage.org">Bitmessage</a>&nbsp;our markets share the same level of
                security as TOR. This is
                because&nbsp;<strong>random&nbsp;</strong>users&nbsp;<strong>deliver&nbsp;</strong>messages making it
                almost impossible to know the original sender. Markets are simply channels the users can listen to. Only
                the people with the decryption key can access the orders on a market and there is no way to prove you
                hold a decryption key. This completely secures you and your personal data.</p>
