								<strong><a href="http://zimbeck.com/">David Zimbeck</a>, our lead developer, is unlike most people you
									will ever meet.</strong> His resilient work ethic, diverse project experience, and deep knowledge of
								cryptography has led to the creation of BitHalo, the world’s first <em>unbreakable</em> smart
								contracting system. These decentralized contracts are the fundamental backbone of BitBay. Born in Ohio
								and having lived all over the world, he has acquired the vast perspective needed to create truly
								disruptive software.</p>

							<p>David is completely self-taught, and intimately knows a hard-day’s work. He developed BitHalo’s first
								50,000 lines of Python code single-handedly from scratch... all while working long, grueling shifts on
								the oil rigs of North Dakota. It was here that he executed his idea of double deposit escrow, bringing
								unbreakable peer-to-peer contracts into real-life agreements.</p>

							<p>As a former world chess master, he also possesses a truly analytical mind. David has a keen
								understanding of cause and effect, and sees the importance of early decisions in any situation. This
								mentality, in addition to his innate honesty, perseverance, and self-discipline has driven him to
								position BitBay <strong>well beyond most other blockchain projects in terms of both development and
									security.</strong></p>

							<p>“<em>Chess has helped me visualize code. It has helped me plan, memorize and problem solve. It has
									helped me anticipate problems well in advance.” </em></p>

							<p>David now resides in Mexico, and continues to work round-the-clock to help keep BitBay on the forefront
								of blockchain development.</p>
